bergwerkLABS - TryJump
============================

This is the complete Rework of the famous minigame TryJump. 
**NOTE**: This project is still a WIP.

Why is this Open Source?
------------------------

Since the server closed, I decided to open source my work for other people to see how things were done.
Feel free to use this code for your own Minecraft network, if you have one.

This project follows the [Google Java code style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) conventions. When working on this project, make sure to follow these rules.
